- Make sure you have Premake5 Installed and on your system Path
  (http://premake.github.io/download.html)

  1. cd into ROOT (where premake5.lua is located)
  2. run premake to generate the project folder
    - To generate a make file (Mac/Linux/Windows)
        premake5 gmake
    - On Windows to create a visual studio Solution (Windows only, assuming VS2015 installed)
        premake5 vs2015
  3. CD into the resulting project_... folder
  4. Build project as usual
    - For make file, running 'make' will run the first option defined in the Makefile
       - Each Project in your workspace has its own folder.
    - For visual studio, just launch the solution file.
